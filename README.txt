How is this program ( or as i say "robot" ) is going to work ?

    -> First step is to create a highly inteligent algorithm that automates 100 % of the publishing process
    -> Second step is to beutify the code
    -> Third step is to make it non-highly complex
    -> Fourth step is to actually take full advantage of the OOP
    
    # - Things to be careful with:
    
        1. Code MUST be easy to understand, with well documented functions
        2. Remember that facebook.com changes it's site every single month, and the code may broke sometime in the future, and need to be rewritten a few times.
        3. Keep track of the development steps on the ( 'how to become a better developer video' )
        4. Pay attention to possible errors and always try to avoid them
            -> Be a better developer in general
