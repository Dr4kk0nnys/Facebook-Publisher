1 How it's going to work:

    * I won't give my code to the buyer *
    * Monthly paying *
    * It's going to run on my machine *

    - Each client will have it's individual file ? Each client will have it's individual directory ?
        -> Option 1:                -> Option 2:
            client_1.py                 client_1
            client_2.py                     -> main.py
            client_3.py                 client_2
            client_4.py                     -> main.py
        
        * Make a MAIN file with the main class holding all the executable functions, and make a sub-file ( with the name of the client )
        in the sub file, add all the primary info ( email, password, title, description, images ... )

    - Apresentation:
        - Make a video of the program working ( in case you don't have wifi )
            - video_path = '/home/dr4kk0nnys/Apresentation.mkv'
        - Show the average time of how long it takes to publish an add, then multiply it for the month and compare it against no time at all spent, using the program
            
            Average time: 3 ~ 5 minutes
            * It takes 45 minutes a day, only to publish the ads ( each add takes: 3 min, 5 adds, 3 times a day )
            * 15 minutes per session
            * Monthly, it takes over 20 hours, only to publish it
